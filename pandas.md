# Data Analysis - the Path of the Panda

## 1. Beginner

* inspect the size of a table
* calculate mean, median, stdev, min and max for a column
* sum up a table by columns or rows
* insert missing values by (value, backward/forward fill, interpolation, KNN)
* concatenate two tables along an equal dimension
* merge two tables by a join condition
* apply arithmetics (+-*/**%) on a column
* round values in a column to two digits
* apply a log or trigonometric functions on a column


### Data Wrangling

* add / remove a column
* modify a single value in a table
* apply a function on a column
* slice a table in x/y direction
* select rows and columns
* set the index of a table
* rename columns
* replace values according to a category
* factorize a categorical column
* extract unique values
* change the type of a column
* sort data by one or more columns (ascending/descending)
* filter a table by values in one column
* conduct a substring search on a column
* find rows whose values is equal to the row exactly above
* extract substrings from a string column
* concatenate two string columns
* alternatingly assign two rows to categories A and B (AABBAABB..)
* create a two-level hierarchical index
* convert a table to a list/dict/array and back
* calculate correlation coefficients between two columns
* apply Regular expressions to extract data

### I/O

* read/write tables in CSV, Excel, JSON and SQL formats
* read text files containing errors
* write a custom file parser
* scrape web pages

### Aggregations

* aggregate groups using a custom function
* count values groups

### Data Transformation

* apply logarithms and trigonometric functions on a column
* apply one-hot encoding
* apply target mean encoding
* bin data using quantiles or fixed intervals
* scale data using to fixed range or a normal distribution
* transpose a table
* create a pivot table (count or sum using two columns as x and y dimensions)
* group data by one categorical column
* group data by two or more columns


## 2. Intermediate

## 3. Advanced

### Hypothesis Testing

* test a column for normal distribution
* test two columns for equality of means
* test two categorical columns for equivalence
* test a time series for stationarity

### Data

* check data types and the memory size of a dataset
* generate random data using different distributions
* store a binary tree in a data structure
* store a graph in a data structure
* convert a graph to an adjacency matrix and back
* calculate frequencies from time series data (signal processing/FFT)
* distribute operations on a large table to multiple computational nodes
* copy a table

### Time Series

* decompose a time series (trend, seasonality, variability)
* plot the autocorrelation function (ACF) of a time series
* calculate a rolling average
* up- and downsample a time series to a new frequency
* normalize by seasonal means
* apply a time delta on a column of time stamps
* apply a time delta on a column of time stamps, skipping weekends
* apply a Cox-Box transformation

### Data Visualization

* plot a function y=f(x)
* draw barplots, line plots, scatterplots and histograms
* draw error bars
* set axis labels and tick marks manually
* export high-resolution images in pixel and vector formats
* color data points by a categorical variabl
* color data points by a scalar
* plot data on a log scale
* use timestamps as a x-axis
* export an animated plot
* draw data on a maps
* draw a choropleth
* plot 3D data
* animate data using a slider
* create an online dashboard
* create a Q-Q-plot
* draw a tree diagram
* draw a graph
* create interactive visualizations
* create customized graphics with other libraries
* create a figure with multiple subplots
* draw a heatmap
* create a scatterplot matrix from multiple columns

## Out-of-Memory Data

* process datasets that does not fit in memory
* process datasets that do not fit on a single machine
* parallelize processing of a dataset

## Sampling

* upsample/downsample a dataset
* draw stratified sub-samples
